# Playwright Tests

## Overview

Create reliable, readable, and maintainable Playwright UI tests with stable
selectors, reusable flows, and flake-resistant assertions. Follow the active
repository's configured test-id attribute and selector conventions.

## Core Principles

- **Arrange, Act, Assert**: separate setup, interactions, and verification.
- **Selectors use the repository convention**: add stable test-id attributes in
  templates only when the repository uses them; never add or mutate them in
  TypeScript.
- **Reuse repeated steps**: extract common flows into helpers or fixtures to avoid duplication.

## Locator Strategy

1. Use the repository's configured test-id attribute when one exists.
2. Prefer `getByTestId()` with stable values when that convention is available.
3. Use semantic locators when no test-id convention exists or when semantics are
   the more stable contract.
4. Avoid CSS/XPath unless there is no other option.

```ts
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit order" }).click();
```

**Naming guidance:** use unique, descriptive, stable names (feature + element + intent). Avoid dynamic values, index-based ids, or styling references.

## Test Structure (AAA)

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("user submits checkout", async ({ page }) => {
  // Arrange
  await page.goto("/checkout");
  await fillCheckoutForm(page);

  // Act
  await page.getByTestId("checkout-submit").click();

  // Assert
  await expect(page.getByTestId("checkout-success")).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Reuse and Abstractions

- Create reusable helpers for repeated steps (login, onboarding, form fills, navigation).
- Prefer small, explicit helper functions and test fixtures over monolithic page objects.
- Use `test.step()` to label complex flows and keep test intent clear.
- Keep helpers deterministic: no hidden waits or random timing.

Example helper:

```ts
export async function fillCheckoutForm(page: Page) {
  await page.getByTestId("checkout-name").fill("Alex");
  await page.getByTestId("checkout-email").fill("alex@example.com");
}
```

## Stability and Flake Resistance

- Use Playwright locators (auto-waiting) and web-first assertions (`expect(...).toBeVisible()`).
- Avoid `waitForTimeout`; wait on specific UI states instead.
- Keep selectors strict and unique; avoid ambiguous matches.
- Ensure tests are isolated: clean state, unique data, no shared mutable globals.
- Use `storageState` or fixtures for authenticated flows; reset state per test.
- Mock network only when necessary for determinism; otherwise test real integrations.

## Debugging and CI Hygiene

- Enable traces/screenshot/video on failure in CI for fast triage.
- Keep tests parallel-safe; avoid cross-test dependencies.
- Tag slow or flaky tests; keep retries limited and justified.
- Use `test.describe` to scope setup and reduce redundant navigation.
