# Workflow Governance

## Governing objective

The workflow helps capable agents produce maintainable, high-quality software
while keeping active context high-signal. Optimise for:

- clear ownership;
- minimal relevant context;
- strong repository evidence;
- deterministic enforcement where possible;
- executable behavioural protection;
- independent judgement where automation cannot decide;
- bounded orchestration; and
- low unnecessary ceremony.

Humans should make product decisions and resolve real trade-offs, not become
routine code-quality bottlenecks. Do not optimise for autonomy or short prompts
as ends in themselves. The objective is maximum useful signal with the minimum
context and ceremony required for the outcome.

## Ownership model

Use this hierarchy when deciding where information or responsibility belongs:

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Durable cross-project engineering judgement |
| Repository code, config, and docs | Repository-specific truth |
| `repo-context` | Observational repository evidence |
| Deterministic tooling and `verify` | Mechanical invariants, including implementation workspace and Git lifecycle safety |
| Tests | Executable behavioural specifications |
| Skills | Specialist expertise |
| Agents | Specialist roles |
| Commands | Workflow orchestration |
| Active session | Temporary task requirements, decisions, and acceptance criteria |
| Human | Product intent, unresolved trade-offs, pull-request review, final product validation, and merge decisions |

Every instruction needs a legitimate owner. Avoid repeating an instruction in
multiple layers unless both layers independently need it, such as reviewer
severity semantics. The target is not zero duplicated words; it is zero
ambiguous ownership.

The workflow skill is the architectural and governance source of truth for this
configuration. It does not replace `AGENTS.md`, specialist expertise, reviewer
protocols, repository validation, or task contracts.

## Decision ladder

When a rule or piece of knowledge is being added, move it toward the strongest
appropriate enforcement or evidence layer:

```text
prose instruction
    -> repository fact or config
    -> compiler, linter, or architecture check
    -> test or executable specification
    -> metric or quality gate
    -> permission boundary
    -> agent judgement
    -> human judgement
```

This is not a demand to automate everything. Some concerns are inherently
judgement-based. Ask whether a concern can be reliably established by
something stronger than asking an LLM to remember prose. If so, prefer that
mechanism and remove the weaker duplicate where practical.

## Context economy

Context is a resource. Every persistent instruction must materially improve a
decision. Prefer progressive disclosure, specialist skills loaded only when
relevant, repository inspection over copied facts, concise role definitions,
active session task contracts, and fresh evidence at decision boundaries.

Avoid giant universal files, framework tutorials for capable models, duplicated
validation instructions, permanent planning artifacts, stale repository
summaries, speculative rules, and loading every specialist skill for every task.
Shorter is not automatically better: intentionally loaded expertise should stay
detailed when it improves decisions. Optimise active context, not byte count.

## Repository-first reasoning

The repository is authoritative for its own implementation. Global guidance
must not impose architecture, APIs, or tooling choices over an intentional
local approach. Resolve decisions using this precedence:

1. explicit task or product requirement;
2. documented repository or product principle;
3. intentional local or feature pattern;
4. repository-wide evidence;
5. specialist expertise;
6. generic preference.

`repo-context` reports observations with evidence and uncertainty; it does not
make architecture decisions. A newer API or fashionable pattern is not an
improvement merely because it is newer.

## Deterministic quality contract

Repositories using the implementation workflow expose `npm run verify`. The
repository owns what that command contains. It may combine formatting, lint,
type checks, tests, builds, architecture boundaries, duplication or complexity
signals, security checks, secrets detection, or other appropriate invariants.
These are examples, not a universal gauntlet.

The global invariant is the interface: `npm run verify` is the repository's
authoritative deterministic quality contract. `/implement` requires a green
baseline before implementation and a green final result afterward. Do not
duplicate repository-specific checks in global prose or add project tooling
from this configuration.

Shared deterministic tooling may suppress captured output for successful checks
while preserving diagnostics for failures. This reporting policy belongs to the
tooling, not to agent instructions. `npm run verify` remains the only repository
quality gate agents invoke; implementation lifecycle commands separately
enforce workspace and Git safety.

Metrics such as CRAP score and duplication are bounded signals, not global
ideology. Prefer scoped or differential enforcement where practical, calibrate
thresholds against real repositories, and do not make legacy code block
unrelated work without evidence. Do not turn this global configuration into a
project gauntlet or add CRAP, duplication, or security tooling here; evaluate
such mechanisms in the repository that owns the code.

## Behaviour and judgement

Important deterministic behaviour acceptance criteria should graduate into
appropriate executable specifications when they are reasonably testable. Use
the cheapest test level that meaningfully proves the behaviour; E2E is
risk-triggered rather than universal. This is behaviour-first, not mandatory
test-first development.

Architectural appropriateness, unnecessary complexity, maintainability, UI
hierarchy, usability, and visual coherence cannot always be reduced to
deterministic checks. Use independent reviewer judgement when it materially
improves confidence. Implementers implement; reviewers judge. Reviewer findings
are evidence to investigate, not commands to obey blindly.

## Orchestration economy

Agents and subagents cost context, latency, tokens, duplicated work, and
possible disagreement. Use them when role separation or specialist expertise
materially improves the result, not merely because they exist. Specialists use
targeted checks while implementing; they do not duplicate the full gauntlet.
The orchestrator owns final verification. Independent reviewers run only when
the change warrants them, and remediation loops remain bounded.

For successful `/implement` execution, the orchestrator also owns routine
delivery from the final green state through committing the intended change,
pushing its feature branch, and creating a pull request. This delivery boundary
must not bypass quality gates, include unrelated work, push feature work to the
default branch, or merge the pull request. The human reviews the completed pull
request, performs final product validation, requests further changes when
needed, and decides whether and when to merge. `/implement` orchestrates the
lifecycle; centralized tooling owns deterministic default-branch
synchronization, session ownership, worktree isolation, safe history updates,
and non-force feature-branch publication. `commit-pr-writing` owns specialist
judgement for commit and pull-request copy.

The normal repository checkout is the control worktree for `/implement`, not
the feature workspace. Each invocation must receive a distinct owned linked
worktree before repository work begins, and all subsequent feature operations
remain there. The tool must fail closed rather than stash user state, reuse an
ambiguously owned worktree, rewrite shared history, or guess through conflicts.
Retain the workspace after pull-request creation so the owning session can make
follow-up changes; PR-state-driven cleanup decides from authoritative GitHub
state plus deterministic Git evidence that the implementation history is
consumed by the remote default branch, protecting open, dirty, metadata-less,
or unproven workspaces fail-closed.

Transient evidence is not deliverable work: screenshots, rendered-inspection
output, analysis documents, and temporary reports are written to a temporary
directory inside the owned implementation worktree or a system temporary
directory — never into the control checkout.

## Session task contracts

The implementation task contract lives only in the active session. It keeps the
request, resolved decisions, scope, and acceptance criteria available during
execution without creating a planning artifact. If implementation reveals
enduring knowledge, graduate it to its proper owner:

- behaviour -> test;
- mechanical invariant -> tooling;
- architecture decision -> repository documentation or configuration;
- recurring specialist judgement -> skill;
- repository fact -> repository itself;
- workflow principle -> this skill.

Do not create permanent or temporary repository documentation merely to preserve
the session contract. The conversation remains execution context rather than a
repository artifact.

## Evidence-driven evolution

Change the workflow in response to observed failures or recurring friction, not
hypothetical completeness. Classify a failure before adding an instruction:

| Failure | Likely owner to investigate |
| --- | --- |
| Deterministic behaviour miss | Test or executable-spec gap |
| Type, lint, or mechanical issue | `verify` tooling gap |
| Repeated architecture violation | Architecture enforcement or reviewer gap |
| Repeated Angular reasoning failure | Angular skill gap |
| Visual, responsive, or usability miss | UI implementation or review gap |
| Contradictory instructions | Governance or ownership gap |
| Repeated unnecessary agent work | Orchestration gap |

Ask:

1. What failed, and what evidence shows it?
2. Which layer should have caught it?
3. Is it recurring enough to justify a workflow change?
4. Can a deterministic mechanism own it?
5. If prose is necessary, which single layer owns it?
6. What existing instruction can be removed or replaced?

Do not answer every failure by adding another prompt sentence. Prefer
substitution, movement, consolidation, or deletion.

Human product validation follows the same discipline. If reviewing the completed
pull request finds a problem after all coding-workflow gates pass, fix the
feature and consider whether the failure class belongs in an executable
specification, tooling, specialist guidance, reviewer guidance, product/UX
principles, or workflow governance. One isolated mistake does not automatically
justify a global change.

## Calibration and audit

Trust in the workflow must remain evidence-based. Occasionally examine real
completed work that passed the workflow and ask whether important issues
escaped. This is calibration, not another mandatory per-change gate. Calibrate
future metric thresholds against real repository evidence.

Do not introduce scheduled audits, mandatory percentages, arbitrary ceremony,
new reviewer agents, or new tooling in this skill without evidence and a
separate justified decision.

## Evolving the configuration

Before changing workflow configuration, inspect the current relevant files and
all instructions touching the concern. Identify the current owner, classify
the issue, and check whether an existing instruction can be replaced or moved.
When responsibility moves, establish the new authoritative owner, remove
obsolete duplicates, search for stale references, and validate the resulting
configuration as a whole.

Audit semantic meaning, not just matching text. Candidate overlaps can be found
with searches, but contradiction requires reasoning about scope and exceptions.
If a proposed change would materially redesign the architecture or lacks
evidence, report it rather than silently expanding the task. "No meaningful
workflow change is justified" is a valid conclusion.
